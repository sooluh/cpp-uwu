# C++ (◡ ω ◡)

Hello everyone who accesses this repository. This is a public repository for
storing C++ codes during my lectures.

1. Directory prefixed `week` is code I write when I have a course and I do
   C++ training.

2. Folder that starts with `task` is the folder that contains my assignments
   in lectures.

3. `oddity` directory is a very funny directory, it is the result of my own
   exploration.

4. A folder named `exam` is a question that appears in the semester exam,
   along with my answer.
