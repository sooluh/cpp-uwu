# Cryptography

Cryptography is a science that studies mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security.

1. [Caesar Cipher](./caesar.cpp)<br>
   The simplest and most famous encryption technique. It uses a linear function!

2. [Vigenere Cipher](./vigenere.cpp)<br>
   This is an optimization of Caesar Cipher.

3. [Fractionatin Cipher](./fraction.cpp)<br>
   Uses a letter splitting method so that each plaintext letter is represented by two symbols.
